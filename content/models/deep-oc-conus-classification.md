Citizen science has become a powerful force for scientific inquiry, providing researchers with access to a vast array of data points while connecting non scientists to the real process of science. This citizen-researcher relationship creates a very interesting synergy, allowing for the creation, execution, and analysis of research projects. With this in mind, a Convolutional Neural Network using ResNet50 has been trained to identify conus marine snails at species level [1] in collaboration with the Museo de Ciencias Naturales in Madrid [2]. 
The taxonomy of these snails has changed significantly several times during recent years and the introduction of Deep Learning techniques allowing to classify them is a very valuable tool for the experts.This Docker container contains a trained Convolutional Neural network optimized for conus snails identification using images. The architecture used is a Resnet50 [3] using Lasagne on top of Theano. The training dataset has been provided by the Museo de Ciencias Naturales de Madrid and it consists on a dataset containing images of 68 species of conus covering three different regions: Panamic region South African region Western atlantic and mediterranean region.
