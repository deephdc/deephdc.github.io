Summary: A generic container that can serve as an example project,
    without real functionality

The DEEP-OC-generic-container model provides no functionality, as it is rather
a boilerplate repository that can serve as an example.

It provides a Dockerfile template allowing to run several DEEP applications in
the same Docker container.
