Citizen science has become a powerful force for scientific inquiry, providing researchers with access to a vast array of
data points while connecting non scientists to the real process of science. 
This citizen-researcher relationship creates a very interesting synergy, allowing for the creation, execution, and analysis
of research projects. With this in mind, a Convolutional Neural Network has been trained to identify phytoplankton in
collaboration with the [Vlaams Instituut voor de Zee](http://www.vliz.be/).

This Docker container contains a trained Convolutional Neural network optimized
for phytoplankton identification using images.
The architecture used is an Xception [1] network using Keras on top of Tensorflow.

As training dataset we have used a collection of images from the [Vlaams Instituut voor de Zee](http://www.vliz.be/)
which consists of around 650K images from 60 classes of phytoplankton.

This service is based in the [Image Classification with Tensorflow](./deep-oc-image-classification-tensorflow.html) model.
