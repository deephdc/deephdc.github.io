# DEEP Data Science template

_A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work. 
Based on more general [template](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)._

To simplify the development and in an easy way integrate a model with [DEEPaaS API](https://github.com/indigo-dc/DEEPaaS),
a project template, [DEEP Data Science template](https://github.com/indigo-dc/cookiecutter-data-science) is offered.

### Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:
 - Python 3.5
 - [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

or

``` bash
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install cookiecutter
```


### To start a new project, run:

    cookiecutter https://github.com/indigo-dc/cookiecutter-data-science


### The resulting directories

Once you answer all the questions, two directories will be created:
 - DEEP-OC-<your_project>
 - <your_project>

each directory is a git repository and has two branches: `master` and `test`.

#### The directory structure of <your_project> looks like this: 

```

```

```
├─ Dockerfile             Describes main steps on integrationg DEEPaaS API and
│                         <your_project> application in one Docker image
